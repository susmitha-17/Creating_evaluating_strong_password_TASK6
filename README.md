# Creating_evaluating_strong_password_TASK6
Evaluate password strength using online tools and identified best practices for creating secure passwords, and how different password attacks work and how strong passwords help protect against them.                    

The task involved testing these passwords using an online password strength evaluation tool (https://www.passwordmeter.com). Each password was analyzed based on several factors, including its length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. The tool provided detailed feedback, showing how certain features like longer length and mixed character types increase password strength, while patterns or sequences reduce it.                   

Through this experiment, the differences between weak and strong passwords became clear. Weak passwords (such as short or predictable ones) can be easily compromised through brute-force or dictionary attacks. On the other hand, strong passwords (with 12 or more characters, mixed symbols, and no obvious patterns) are significantly harder to break.                

Additionally, the task included researching common password attacks such as brute-force, dictionary, phishing, and credential stuffing, which helped in understanding how attackers attempt to steal passwords. This step emphasized the importance of creating unique, complex passwords and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.                        

Overall, this task provided hands-on experience in evaluating password strength, identifying weak points, and learning best practices for password creation and management to enhance personal and organizational security.
